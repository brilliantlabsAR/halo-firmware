"""
Tests that a Lua file on the device is executed, both via require() and via a
Ctrl-D reset.

This test necessarily installs its own main.lua, because the reset path re-runs
whatever main.lua is present. It therefore saves the device's existing main.lua
first and restores it afterwards, and does its cleanup in a finally block so an
interrupted run cannot leave an infinite-loop main.lua running at every boot.
